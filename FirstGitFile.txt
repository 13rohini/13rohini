Hello
This is a new file.
I have created this on the desktop via terminal.
I want to commit this and upload this into 13rohini github repository.
So I have added and installed VSCode and GIt Desktop app.
I hope this works this time
I struggled a bit to figure out how to get the web copy syncronised with the local git copy.
Hope this works
